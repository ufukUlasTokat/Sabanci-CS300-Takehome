The reaping is a nerve-wracking time because it determines which boy and girl  ages 12 to 18  will serve as the district s tributes in the Hunger Games  Two tributes are drawn in each of the 12 districts of Istanbul and those tributes are sent to an arena where they fight until only one tribute remains alive  The victor gets to return home  and the victor s district is showered with gifts — namely food  The Games  put on by the Capitol ankara  are meant to punish the 12 districts of Panem as well as to remind them of the Dark Days and how the 13th district was obliterated for its uprising against the tyrannical and cruel Capitol
